This package is written in ANSI C and was tested only under SuSE Linux 7.2,
Debian (sid), FreeBSD 5.2-RELEASE but should compile with little or no 
change under any other UNIX-like OS.

SLisp is a simple Lisp interpreter that implements most of the common
Lisp constructs.  It may be useful for learning the basis of the
Lisp language.
