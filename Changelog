I have added a break console that show information about functions.
(have to complete the documentation )

Correct the fact that if you have an error the programs quits

Added a new type of object: DOUBLE to handle math funcion in LIBC

added functions: elt, length, sin, cos

Tue Jul 20 15:41:55 ART 2004

Fixed some bugs
Added functions: sort. (using heapsort)
Finished documentation of common functions.

Thu Jul 22 02:50:10 ART 2004

Fixed some bugs
Finished the break console. 
Added howto menu.
Both break and howto now uses readline.
added some new functions.
Added &show-objects functions, to show used objects by the interpreter

Provided a free function that free an object (useless)

Fixed some bugs
Make use of getoptlong
Added new functions
Slisp now load a set of lisp-programmed functions (lib/lisp.h) at startup
so we can made lisp-functions, declare constants, etc... in this header.

Added bignum support using GMP (read docs/gmp.txt)

Mon Aug 2 15:37:44 ART 2004

Finished added bignum support.

Added a lot of functions, most important are: mapcar, and let, fread, execute :)

Now break, is a fork process :)
(i`m tired, not sleep well, sorry about the smiles )

fixed some bugs...

so, well, here it`s 2.1 version :) 

Thu Aug 5 04:08:28 ART 2004

Added howto, and listf commands
fixed some bugs... 

Sun Aug 8 05:05:37 ART 2004

Now... interpreter support readline (if you want)
If `fully' POSIX and ISO C99 compatible
Added heapsort function, in case stdlib doesn`t have one
some other things
fixed LOT OF bugs :P


Now let binds variables :) don`t set

Well... Lot of changes...
/* */
If you decide to use GMP, everything is an string.
As you can see we remove the integer and double 'cases', because now the lexer returns string on everthing that is numeric...
And princ_object prints a number without '"'

Note that, everything before 
...
#ifdef HAVE_GMP
...

and after

#endif
...

must retrain the string numeric value check, coz those functions are `numeric library' independent.

/* */

I correct the num_string function, cos it doesn`t works.
I added some interesting functions.. as variance, ord, qres, etc...
Now the -i arguments changes it behavoir:
If you specify the '-i' flag, then the interpreter will read the file and continue, else it would interpret,report errors, and exit :)

/* IMPORTANT */

Fixed bug. :)

When you define a function like (defun a() (+ 2 3)) this would cause an error, because of the do-while statement in eval_func function. Now is fixed
