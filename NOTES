NOTE:

    If you enter this:

>> (! 1)

    You expect to get something like:

slisp: function `!' is undefined
=> nil

    But the `!' char is not specified in lexer.c as an identifier, so the lexer
    would return the character, and the parser would notify you this:

1: unexpected character `!'
=> nil


just add:
	case '!':
	
In the got_id label in lexer.c 

hehe... backquote, and let, are so obscure...

Have Fun
